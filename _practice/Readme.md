# Intuition Behind The Analysis

We have to make dummy datasets for the process. Natural Language Processing might use some Deeplearning methods to come up with efficient solution.

## Dataset Requirements
- User Raised Ticket Description
- Pre-defined IssueCategories / Softwares / Issues
- If not able to recognize create a new cluster of the node

## To Train Model
- Problem defination and solution approch
- Input Data
- Creation of initial Datasets
- Expliratory Data Analysis
- Feature Grouping
- Predictive Modeling (KClustering, Means, Random Forest maybe.)
